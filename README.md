# Simple Text Editor
This is a simple text editor (like nano, vim, or emacs) run on a Linux shell window writen in C++. While it doesn't load or save the contents of files, and it doesn't have the same rich array of commands that you might expect to see in a "real" text editor, it does form the basis of my exploration of a few key C++ and object-oriented programming concepts.

### Notes
This project was created in my ICS 45C Spring 2020 course. https://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics45c/ProjectGuide/Project4/

I am unable to publicly post my code for this project online because that would violated my university's plagerism guidelines.
